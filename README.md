# AdventOfCode with PHP

My take on the AdventOfCode.com puzzles.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Windows, please consider using [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+) and Make
2. Run `make build` to build fresh images
3. Run `make up` to set up and start a fresh Symfony project
4. Once done, run `make down` to stop the Docker containers.

> [!TIP]
> Run `make help` to see all available commands
